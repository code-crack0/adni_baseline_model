# Alzheimer's Detection System BaseLine Model
## Dataset
### We have used the data of 77 patients from 3 classes (AD,CN,MCI). The downloaded images were in .nii format which have been conveted to .png format, with of the 3d images producing multiple slices.

### After converting the images to png (nii_to_png.py), we ended up having around 14000 png images. We then trained them on the ResNet model and the results have been shown below.
### model_resnet.py need to be run after getting the train_test_split from the link below.
